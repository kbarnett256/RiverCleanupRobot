This folder contains the latest mission configuration files for the Kingfisher.
This includes the configuration block for running the pBrains app automatically
when the simulator is launched, as well as the fixed simulator configuration 
files, and the edited behavior configuration file that adds the collision avoidance
behaviors to the project.

Copy this folder into your /moos-ivp/ivp/missions folder to use the files to run or 
simulate the mission.
